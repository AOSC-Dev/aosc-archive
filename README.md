# aosc-archive
Anthon Optical Storage Center - https://aosc.io

# Purpose
This is the graveyard for all of the retired packages, and the time capsule of the AOSC.

WARNING: Only the two file manifests are stored here. You have to order a file or disc to obtain the actual file.

# Archived Projects
- Repository: The repository with outdated packages
- AOSCC: Anthon Open Source Community Conference text/multimedia records

# File Structure
The actual files are stored under the same directory hierachy. In a nutshell: Project/path/to/file

In addition to the actual files, two files exist to help the user to locate any file from the huge archive library:

## Tree
The directory tree to help you to find a file.

## Checksum
The MD5 checksum of all of the files in the tree

As the MITM attack is almost impossible, a weak hash such as MD5 is way more sufficient
as the purpose of it is just to make sure there is no I/O Error such as corrupted bit.
